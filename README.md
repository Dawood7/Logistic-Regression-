This is my first Logistic Regression project. This project was done from the famous Titanic Dataset on Kaggle.
I first did the imports.
then read the csv file and did some exploratory data analysis.
Then i did some data cleaning on the age and cabin column.
Then I split the data into training set and test set.
Then i used Logistic Regression to do predictions and test my models accuracy.
